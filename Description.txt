Simulation of an epidemic using methods of molecular dynamics

-> Idea to reduce the O(n^2) connected with the calculations of the distances
	Split the field into fields and add overlaping fields to catch boundary agents.
	It's only necessary to iterate over the elements inside the own field and the connected overlaping fields, dropping the effects
	of further distant elemtents. This is only applicable for non long range interactions!
	This procedure could also be parallised, although the overlaping fields have to be treated with care.
	This could be done this way:
	We take a field Fi with elements ai in this field. There are Ni elements in field Fi. The overlaping fields connected are Fi<-j and Fi<-k, with Noj and Nok elements.
	- First, calculate all the distances d_ji and forces (vectos of size d) inside Fi with d_ji = Sum{Sum{aj - ai, (j, i, Ni + Noi + Nok)}, (i, 0 , Ni)}. The index j also interates over the elemtents
	  inside the overlaping field, to calculate the forces this particles feel from this part. Note however that index i does not iterate
	  over the overlaping fields, to avoid read and write access problems with parallelisation. The total force (we use superposition and add the forces) decides the velocity of the particle.
	- The particle position of the particle is changed and it may change into an overlaping field. In this case it is no longer inside Fi.
	- After all the fields have been calculated (with can be run parallise), we use the same formular on the overlaping fields and treat them as 
	  ordinary fields.
	- This process can be iterated until the desired time or state is reached.

	To simulate infection spreading we use a compulsive force either for social distancing on its own or changing on whether on agent
	shows simtoms. This is captured using a system of states, changing the compulsing strength and the mass of the agent. A high mass
	leads to slower movement. We also implement an friction force, to avoid unrealistic bouncing.
